https://www.ijaiem.org/Volume2Issue4/IJAIEM-2013-04-30-130.pdf


# Requirements
    - Research paper: load balancing by maxmin algorithm in private cloud environment
        - **prefer since has implemented only one algorithm
        - They have used maxmin algo, and plotted metrics using dummy values
        - Approach
            - Implement improved maxmin and plot the same metrics


# Proposed MaxMin algorithm
Task: T1
Machine: M1
Estimated time when the task T1 will be completed from now on machine M1: ET(T1, M1)
Time from now when machine M1 will be available for processing: MAT(M1)
Estimated execution time for task T1 on M1: MT(T1, M1)
