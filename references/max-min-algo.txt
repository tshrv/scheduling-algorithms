# Max Min Algorithm

tasks:      List of tasks
machines:   List of machines

calculate ready_time for each machine

while tasks:
    # calculate completion time for each task with each machine
    for task in tasks:
        for machine in machines:
            completion_time[task, machine] = execution_time[task][machine] + ready_time[machine]

    # task_k: the task with maximum completion time
